			            <p class="paragraph">
                            Earlier this week, Margo, Noah, Alex, and Joe all came to the same devastating realization. Their friend, who they’d so recently been spending time with, was now dead. Emily was no longer with them.</p>
			            <p class="paragraph">Emily's friends, Margo, Noah, Alex, and Joe, who were the last to see her alive, are now at the center of the investigation. The group of five had attended a rave, a notorious setting for substance abuse, where they encountered a series of events that would have dire consequences.</p>
			            <p class="paragraph">Emily's obituary reveals that she had ingested MDMA shortly before her passing. By itself the drug is not enough to kill. However, when combined with a disadvantageous physical environment, health, and mental state, the substance has the potential to bring out deeply buried urges in its users.</p>
			            <p class="paragraph">The friend group has since been questioned by the authorities. It has been revealed that they’d gone to a rave. The rave is where Emily was given MDMA. At a certain point in the night, she was found unresponsive by the friend group. This would be her first and final encounter with the substance.
                        </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Keeping all of this in mind, special emphasis should be placed on the importance of looking after one another. Would this have happened if the group took better care of each other?
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">With a yearly influx of new students into the city, questions about the responsibility of locally important institutions regarding harm reduction arise. This death could have been prevented, the question of what if will forever linger in the minds of observers and close ones alike.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="border-middle">The death marks a dark chapter in the history of the city, how did things get this bad?
