                The night was young and tensions were high. It was another typical night out in the streets of Groningen; as avid party fiends flock into the night. Faces and limbs seem to blur into one. The sense of the unknown becomes overwhelming: a sensation known all too well by a rapidly growing population of young students experimenting with substance abuse. A group of friends begins to tear at the seams, senses dulled and inhibitions high within their state of chemically induced elation. 
What happens when a series of rising afflictions reach boiling point? Just how quickly could a thrilling night of fun turn tragic in a heartbeat?'</p>

                            The tragedy marks a void in harm-reduction practices among the student community of the city. 
                            Emily's friends, who were the last to see her alive, are now at the center of the investigation.  </p>
                            <h3 class="border-middle">Earlier this week, Margo, Noah, Alex, and Joe all came to the same devastating realization.</h3>
                        <br/>
			            <p class="paragraph"> Their friend, who they’d so recently been spending time with, Emily was no longer with them, she was dead.  They encountered a series of events that would have dire consequences. Drugs have been a recent point of contention, MDMA specifically has been making headlines in the Netherlands. 65% of students in Groningen say they’ve tried ecstasy or MDMA at least once.

                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> Emily’s obituary reveals that she had ingested a dangerous amount of MDMA shortly before her passing. By itself the drug is not enough to kill. However, when combined with a disadvantageous physical environment, health, and mental state, can be harmful, potentially to an extreme extent. If a user's psyche remains shaken after a traumatic event or episode, the substance can give these unprocessed emotions a potentially damaging outlet. 
                        </p>   
                        <h3 class="border-middle">The friend group has since been questioned by the authorities.</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="paragraph">It has been revealed that they’d been on an intense, drug-filled, night out. Authorities have gained access to social media accounts of the friend group that suffered the loss, the account helps in documenting the night out as a complete, more coherent whole. Emily was given MDMA towards the end of the night. At a certain point, she was found unresponsive by the friend group. This would be her first and final encounter with the substance.

                    <br/>
                    <p class="paragraph">Special emphasis should be placed on the importance of looking after one another. Would this have happened if the group took better care of each other? Outside of this ocurrence, does the city have a responsibility to offer help to the people that need it? How did things get this bad?

                    <h3 class="border-middle">DARE: To Do Drugs has made a podcast to shed light on the nuanced conversation around the subject</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="paragraph">The organization is seeking to right this wrong, education remains to be the best form of risk-mitigation. With a yearly influx of new students into the city, questions about the responsibility of locally important institutions regarding harm reduction arise. This death could have been prevented, the question of what if will forever linger in the minds of observers and close ones alike.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Emily’s passing marks a dark chapter in the history of the city. She will be remembered by her friends, family, and the community at large. By sharing her story as well as others that bear similarity, we can collectively in a process of harm reduction.
